3. How to build?
Download dependencies, then open workspace in Xcode and build for a simulator

4. How to deploy?
You can compile the application on Xcode onto an iOS device which will automatically identify with the Firebase backend and can work independently of a desktop/

5. If applicable, how to administer?
Access to the Firebase backend will provide administrative access. Credentials can be provided upon request.

6. If deployed, how to access?
